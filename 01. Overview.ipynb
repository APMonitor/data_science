    "\n",
    "Package management in data science and machine learning is an important topic because of the pace of new releases. It may be important to have the latest or a specific version of a package.\n",
    "\n",

    "Packages used in this course include `gekko`, `keras`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `pyserial`, `sklearn`, `tclab`, `tensorflow`, and others. If there is an error that you are missing a package then `!pip install gekko` is typically sufficient to retrieve and install it. The `!` tells Jupyter to run from the system command line, not as a Python command although the `!` is now optional for `pip` in the latest version of Jupyter. Add `--user` (not your specific user name) if you do not have administrative privilege on the computer. The package manager `pip` retrieves the [lastest version of gekko](https://pypi.org/project/gekko/) from `pypi` and installs it in the Python distribution."
