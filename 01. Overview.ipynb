    "Every programmer must have basic background knowledge before using the language in more complex projects. This tutorial steps through basic data science skills to analyze the more complex temperature data. The 12 exercises are designed to be completed in 2-3 hours (15-20 minutes each) but sections can be skipped if you already have the background knowledge.\n",
