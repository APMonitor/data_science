    "Interpolation constructs new prediction points from a discrete set of known data points. There are many types of interpolation such as nearest neighbor (piecewise constant), linear, polynomial, [cubic spline](https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/ObjectCspline), and [basis spline](https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/ObjectBspline). In interpolation, the data provide the shape of the approximate function, with piecewise or higher-order polynomial equations to exactly match the data points at those given discrete locations.\n",
