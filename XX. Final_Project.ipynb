    "\n",
    "There are several modes of heat transfer including **radiative**, **convective**, and **conductive**. *Radiative heat transfer* is from the motion of particles and emitted as electromagnetic photons primarily as infrared radiation. *Convective heat transfer* is with the surrounding fluid such as air. Convection can be forced such as from a blower or natural such as in quiescent conditions. *Conductive heat transfer* is through solid contact as the energy transfers away but, unlike convection, the contact material is stationary.\n",
